# Skyblock Classic Datapack

A datapack for Skyblock Classic with no modification to the vanilla experience of the base game.

This datapack focuses primarely on advancements. Unlike vanilla advancements, these will not give rewards to the player.

Classic advancements are based on the original submission on [minecraftmaps.com](https://www.minecraftmaps.com/survival-maps/skyblock) from 2012. Minecraft changed a lot since then, so new advancements are required for completeness. These will be shown on a separate view from the classic advancements.
